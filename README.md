    <h1>Web Scraping Project for CVM Financial Data</h1>

    <p>This is an essential component of my research project, whose main objective is to perform web scraping of financial statement data, such as the Income Statement (IS), the Cash Flow Statement (CFS), and the Balance Sheet, of companies listed on B3 (Brazil's Stock Exchange). The fundamental purpose of this project is to create a robust database that can be used for detailed and comprehensive investment analysis.</p>

    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Financial Data Collection:</strong> The project aims to collect accurate and up-to-date financial data from companies listed on B3. This includes crucial information from financial statements, such as revenues, expenses, cash flow, and financial position.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> The collected data is stored in a structured database that allows easy access and querying. This facilitates analysis and report generation.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> A crucial part of the project is to ensure that the data is updated regularly. This is essential to ensure that investment analyses are based on up-to-date and accurate information.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Project Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Facilitating Investment Analysis:</strong> The resulting database from this project will serve as a valuable source of information for analysts and investors interested in companies listed on B3.</li>
        <li><strong>Informed Decision Making:</strong> Updated data enables investors to make more informed investment decisions by identifying trends and evaluating the financial performance of companies.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation of Updates:</strong> The project includes an automation mechanism that allows for regular updates of financial data, ensuring that the information is always up to date and ready for use.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project is a work in progress, and we will continue to enhance and expand its functionalities to meet the growing needs of investment analysis.</p>
